How to use:
  - build with make
  - the program reads from stdin!
  - the input has the following format:
  
  --------------------
  number_of_pairs
  timestamp realValue
  timestamp realValue
  timestamp realValue
  timestamp realValue
  ...
  --------------------
  
  - use the following command:
    ./tema1 −−command1 −−command2 −−command3
  
  - a command is one of the following keywords:
    1. "e1" eliminates exceptions
    2. "e2" eliminates noise with median filtering
    3. "e3" eliminates noise with arithmetical filtering
    4. "u" is used to damp frequency
    5. "c" is used for data completion
    6. "st<delta>" creates statistics based on the input; "delta" is a positive integer
